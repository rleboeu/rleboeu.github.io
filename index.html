    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my corner of the internet! This purpose of this website is to help you, the reader, get to know me better.
      The idea for this website was inspired by <a href="http://catb.org/esr" target="_blank">ESR</a>. I encourage you to check
      out his website if you are interested in the 'hacker culture' or if you are bored and are looking for an entertaining and often humorous read.

    <h3> Professional Life </h3>
   	<p>
      I'm currently a college student at Midlands Technical College (soon to be USC Columbia) in the Engineering department. Now, I'm
      <i>terrible</i> when it comes to calculus, which is part of the reason I elected to major in Computer Science. Another aspect of my
      choice stems from the fact that I've been coding since sophomore year of high school. I started with Java, went to C/C++ during
      my stint at Clemson, completed a majority of <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> with Python, and
      am back to Java at MTC. I still write SHELL and Python scripts in my free time: How else would I automate everything on my Linux install?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, I hope to graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science from USC. From there, I plan to get an internship with a company (my
      current two prospectives are Blue Cross Blue Shield and Dominion Energy), and then sign on full-time if I enjoy the work environment but
      also the work itself. I was fortunate enough to intern with Dominion Energy already; I worked as a Software Engineer Intern for IST Fossil/Hydro
      at the Cayce, SC location. I loved the people there and the work was immersive even though I had no prior experience with any of the technologies
      (ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server). I was lucky enough to actually get my own written code pushed into production! It was a great learning experience
      and I would go back in a heartbeat.

    <h3> Setup </h3>
    <p>
      I'm an avid participant in the FOSS ecosystem and as a result code on Linux whenever I can. However, this isn't always<br/>
      possible due to employer or software requirements. I switch between Arch Linux, Pop_OS!, and Windows 10 to code depending<br/>
      on what the task requirements are. I have a significant addiction to GNOME and i3.<br/>
      For the specs of my computer:<br/>
      <ul>
        <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X @ 3.7GHz</li>
        <li>Motherboard: Asus ROG STRIX B450-F GAMING ATX</li>
        <li>RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3000</li>
        <li>Storage: Kingston A400 120GB SSD, Samsung 860 Evo 250GB SSD</li>
        <li>GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB SC</li>
        <li>Case: NZXT H500 ATX Mid Tower</li>
        <li>PSU: Corsair CXM 550W 80+ Bronze Semi-modular</li>
      </ul>
