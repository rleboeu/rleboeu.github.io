  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <h2> Personal </h2>
 	<p>
    Welcome to my corner of the internet!<br/>
    Computers have always been a passion of mine. I started coding with Java and Python and love both to this day.<br/>
    In my free time, I enjoy messing around with Python, breaking my Linux install, sketching, cooking, and rewatching NCIS on Netflix.<br/>
  </p>

  <h2> Setup </h2>
  <p>
    I'm an avid participant in the FOSS ecosystem and as a result code on Linux whenever I can. However, this isn't always<br/>
    possible due to employer or software requirements. I switch between Arch Linux, Pop_OS!, and Windows 10 to code depending<br/>
    on what the task requirements are. I have a significant addiction to GNOME and i3.<br/>
    For the specs of my computer:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X @ 3.7GHz</li>
      <li>Motherboard: Asus ROG STRIX B450-F GAMING ATX</li>
      <li>RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB (2x8) DDR4-3000</li>
      <li>Storage: Kingston A400 120GB SSD, Samsung 860 Evo 250GB SSD</li>
      <li>GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB SC</li>

    </ul>
